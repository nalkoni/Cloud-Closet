# Cloud Closet


## Description

Gone the days of the closet monster. Say hello to Cloud Closet, a web application that allows users to create and access their closets anywhere. Cloud Closet liberates a user so they can start their day or trip right. It is as simple as signing up, creating a closet and uploading items. Users can also filter their closet by different filter options, check the weather, and add to their consignment closet or their donation closet. Once a user has set up their Cloud Closet they can stop wondering what is inside that dark hole and take advantage of the wasted time in getting dressed or packing a suitcase. Cloud Closet is here to help pinpoint all closet related problems and find a solution to them.
